        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-md-8 well">

                    <div class="thumbnail col-sm-4"><img src="../images/Me.jpg"></div>
                    <h2 class="col-sm-8">Hi there! My name is Michael and I come from California, but I currently live in Rwanda with my beautiful and hilarious wife, Angel.</h2>
                    <h4 class="col-sm-8">My time in Rwanda</h4>
                    <p class="col-sm-8"> I am finishing three years of volunteering for the Peace Corps in Rwanda. In my time here, I taught English at a secondary school and served as a Volunteer Leader.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">While teaching in a remote village in Rwanda, I also facilitated after-school activities, including an English club and two life skills clubs. I taught and facilitated at three youth camps in the Eastern region of Rwanda, including serving as the Director of Training for one of those camps.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">As a Volunteer Leader, I assisted in the training and support of new Volunteers. This includes making site visits to Volunteers, with clearance to operate US government vehicles in Rwanda. I also helped to launch and maintain the very first <a href="http://rwanda.peacecorps.gov">Peace Corps | Rwanda</a> website using Drupal Gardens. Additionally, I helped develop a Memorandum of Understanding between the government of Rwanda and the Coffee and Exporters Association of Rwanda in partnership with One Acre Fund.</p>
                    <h4 class="col-sm-9">My previous work</h4>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">Before my time in Rwanda, I worked at Union Bank in California as a teller. I received excellent training there and I was one of two tellers in the branch who were authorized to initiate international wire transfers. I was recruited for the position while working at my previous job at Starbucks because I gave such good service to the bank manager that she asked me to apply.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">While at Starbucks I helped train new employees and I was known for my ability to consistently give excellent customer service. I previously worked at a local coffee shop, giving me over five years of experience as a barista. At that time I had a voracious appetite for knowledge about everything coffee. I practiced making latte art, I tried to perfect my espresso shots, and I even roasted my own coffee beans at home. <em>Practicing skills in my own time would become an endless life pirsuit for me.</em></p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">Selling (and drinking) coffee, as well as tutoring at a community college, helped me to pay for my college tuition. I graduated from California State University, San Bernardino with a B.S. in Business Administration in 2010. I concentrated on Marketing and Sports & Entertainment Marketing. I consistently appeared on the National Dean's List. During my last quarter of study I completed a Marketing Plan for the CSUSB Career Development Center.</p>
                    <h4 class="col-sm-9">Early Career</h4>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">I graduated from high school at the age of 16. I worked hard to get ahead by taking summer courses and concurrently attending a community college. I quickly learned that it is difficult to get work as a young, inexperienced teenager.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">My first job was as a temporary worker helping the Visual Manager at a Gottschalks department store during the holiday season. The manager went on pregnancy leave and I ended up taking over the job when she decided not to come back. It was a big responsibility for a seventeen-year-old to work as a manager in my first job. I learned a lot while I was there. <em>One thing that I have taken away from that job that I continue to practice in every job since is taking initiative to complete projects on my own with little direction.</em></p>
                    <h4 class="col-sm-9">The jack of all trades...</h4>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">The well known saying goes "Jack of all trades, master of none." It means that spreading one's time across many skill sets can be an impediment to becoming exceptional at any one skill. But <em>proficiency</em> in many skills is not a bad thing. I pride myself on learning about any subject I become curious about. Education is an ongoing, lifelong endeavor. I strive to be a Renaissance Man, a polymath.</p>
