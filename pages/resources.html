                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">I started off my learning experience over at codecademy. They have excellent beginner courses for html and CSS. I already knew some html when I started, so some of it was review for me, but it was all great practice nonetheless.</p></div>

The courses on html and CSS are great for any beginner. The best part is that they are all free!</em></p></div></div>
                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">One of my favorite courses on codecademy is their project of building a responsive web page using Bootstrap. This project taught me how to create a web page with different screen sizes in mind, including smart phones.</p></div>

                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">While it's possible to code a web page entirely in a basic text editor, you're probably going to want a program that's built specifically for web coding. There are several options out there, but I decided to use Brackets. It's open source, which means it's free! I especially like Brackets because it codes real-time in your browser. You can see the changes being made to your page as you make them.</p></div>
                    <div class="container well col-xs-11"><img class="col-xs-12" src="../images/Brackets.jpg"/><div class="caption col-xs-12"><p id="codeCademy-caption"><em>Brackets shows you changes in your browser as you make them!</em></p></div></div>
                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">Some of the other features of Brackets are: color-coded tags, image and color code previews on mouse hover, tag suggestions as you type, and so many other cool, subtle features that make using it a good experience.</p></div>    
                  
                    <h3 class="col-xs-12"><li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a></li></h3>
                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">Bootstrap is developed by some of the good people over at Twitter. It's basically a set of pre-written html, CSS, jQuery and other code that you can download for free and use to build your own web pages. Bootstrap speeds up the process of coding your site because much of the CSS is already written for you. You simply need to learn how to use some of the pre-determined classes and you're good to go!</p></div>
                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">Bootstrap also gives you the ability to create a scalable, responsive website. That means that your site will look good on any size screen! <em>Go ahead, resize your browser window and see how this page looks!</em> The page should respond by scaling to fit your screen size. That's why it's called <em>responsive</em> web design. You might even notice that the nav bar at the top of the page collapsed into a dropdown menu as you adjusted the browser window. That's the beauty of responsive web design, thanks to Bootstrap.</p></div>

                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">This guy's got some great videos on YouTube! When I started to follow his tutorials, my learning pace really picked up. He moves a little quickly, but I like his fast pace. And the good thing about videos is you can always pause and catch up.</p></div>
                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">After completing the courses on html and CSS at codecademy, this guy's videos on those subjects were review. But having commentary while going along was like having a teacher in a classroom. Watching and emulating a professional is a good way to improve your skills!</p></div>

                    <div class="container"><p class="col-xs-10">GitHub is like social media for coders. You can upload your code to the site and other people can see it and make changes if they wish. They then upload the files with the changes and GitHub tracks what changes were made. It's a great way to collaborate on projects or to get feedback on your own. In fact, GitHub is where this website is hosted!</p></div>
