                    <h2 class="col-sm-8">Responsive Web Design</h2>
                    <p class="col-sm-8"> This website you are currently viewing is coded from scratch. It was not created using a template like Wordpress or Wix. It does, however, get some help from Bootstrap, a front-end framework for web development.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">With Bootstrap you can quickly create responsive websites with pre-compiled html and CSS. <em>Responsive</em> means that the user has a similar experience on the website no matter what their screen size is. Go ahead, resize your screen! Watch the elements on the page rearrange themselves to fit your screen.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">I also have experience with WYSIWYG editors, especially Drupal Gardens, which I used to help launch the <a href="http://rwanda.peacecorps.gov">Peace Corps|Rwanda</a> website.</p>

                    <h2 class="col-sm-8">Computers</h2>
                    <p class="col-sm-8"> I like computers. I've assembled several of them myself. While I was living and teaching in a village in Rwanda, I spent many late nights helping a Korean volunteer put together several machines that utilized NComputing, a virtual desktop system, for the school computer lab.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">I'm no programmer (yet), but I know my way around computers. I'm proficient with Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as applications available on Mac OS.</p>

                    <p class="col-sm-8">While I don't write professionally, I still count it as a skill that I have. I studied journalism in high school. I helped my students in Rwanda run a school newpaper. I was a writing tutor in college. I blog. I sometimes contribute to <a href="http://somarwanda.weebly.com/">SOMA Rwanda</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="col-sm-8">Coffee</h2>
                    <p class="col-sm-8"> Coffee became a bit of an obsession when I was a barista. I watched YouTube videos to help me learn how to pull the perfect shot, steam delicious micro foam with milk and how to create latte art (those fun designs drawn in your milk with the flick of a wrist). I joined online forums and discussed how to make better coffee.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">Eventually I started ordering my own green beans from <a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/store/">Sweet Maria's.</a>I purchased a moka pot, an aeropress and a French press. I tried every roast, grind and brew method I could without breaking the bank.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">I guess what I love so much about coffee is that it is very much an art, yet it is also very scientific. It allows you to express yourself creatively while at the same time you are applying scientific principles to get ever closer to the perfect cup.</p>

                    <h2 class="col-sm-8">Travel</h2>
                    <p class="col-sm-8"> Admittedly, I never traveled much before joining the Peace Corps. The journey to staging was the first time I had ever been on a plane! But once I saw Brussels, backpacked through East Africa, and relaxed on the beaches of Zanzibar, I was <em>hooked</em>.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">The sense of adventure in arriving somewhere and figuring things out as you go along is worth more than the sense of security in staying in familiar places.</p>

                    <h2 class="col-sm-8">Reading</h2>
                    <p class="col-sm-8"> Before my Kindle went belly up, I was reading on average two to four books a week. I mostly read non-fiction. Reading is great because it is like absorbing information. I have been known to go on wiki-binges--spending hours on Wikipedia.org clicking on links to feed the hunger for more and more information.</p>

                    <h2 class="col-sm-8">Baking Bread</h2>
                    <p class="col-sm-8"> One day I wanted to learn how to bake fresh bread. So I looked up some recipes, bought some flour and got to work in the kitchen. My first loaf was horrible! It was dense and all around not delicious.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">But I didn't give up and eventually my bread became the first thing to disappear at potlucks. Bread baking taught me about persistence, experimentation, and patience. And nothing beats a fresh-baked loaf of bread with dinner!</p>

                    <p class="col-sm-8"> At left is a photo of my car, a 2007 Honda Accord. It's not a luxury car. It's not even the first car that I've owned. But it is special to me because I take care of it. I do all of the maintenance myself, including washing and detailing.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-8">I have learned how to care for things to make them last from owning this car. I left the car with my parents when I moved to Rwanda. I purchased a family sedan with the intent to get much use out of it when I eventually have a family of my own. I look forward to getting the car back when I return home with my new wife.</p>

                    <p class="col-sm-8"> That's me bunjee jumping over the Nile River. This was after spending a day white water rafting the rapids down the river. A few months before I was pushing an SUV out of the mud in Akagera National Park, and before that I was hiking to the top of a volcano in Volcanoes National Park. I believe life is about being <em>alive</em>.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">Everything is possible with enough motivation. When I catch myself saying, "I've always wanted to do that," I try to find a way to say instead, "I remember when I did that. It was so much fun!"</p>
